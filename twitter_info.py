## 5. Click "Create your Twitter application"
## 6. Click on the Keys and Access Tokens tab on the next screen
## 7. The Consumer Key (API Key) and Consumer Secret (API Secret) should be visible, strings of letters and numbers. Copy those into the strings below for consumer_key and consumer_secret variables.

## 11. (Don't share this file with anyone or push it to a public GitHub repository -- it contains access to your Twitter account!)
